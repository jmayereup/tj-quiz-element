        Science Reading: Earth, Matter, and Atoms
        ---instructions
        Part 1: Volcanoes
        Read the text below. Pay attention to the different types of volcanoes.
        ---text
        Volcanoes
        A volcano is like a mountain that opens downward to a pool of molten rock below the surface of the Earth. When
        pressure builds up, eruptions occur. Gases and rock shoot up through the opening and spill over or fill the air
        with lava fragments.

        Hot liquid rock under the Earth's surface is called magma. When it comes out of the volcano, it is called lava.
        Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct. An active volcano can erupt at any time. A dormant volcano has not
        erupted recently but might again. An extinct volcano will not erupt again. Many volcanoes are in the Ring of
        Fire, which is an area around the edge of the Pacific Ocean.
        ---questions-4
        Q: What causes an eruption?
        A: The mountain gets too cold.
        A: Pressure builds up below the surface. [correct]
        A: The ocean water enters the volcano.
        Q: What is the "Ring of Fire"?
        A: A circle of fire made by campers.
        A: An area around the Pacific Ocean with many volcanoes. [correct]
        A: A type of hot rock.
        Q: Which type of volcano will NOT erupt again?
        A: Active
        A: Dormant
        A: Extinct [correct]
        Q: What shoots up through the opening during an eruption?
        A: Only water.
        A: Gases and rock. [correct]
        A: Plants and trees.
        ---vocab
        molten: turned into liquid by great heat
        eruption: a sudden explosion of rocks and fire
        fragment: a small piece that has broken off
        active: doing something; working right now
        extinct: no longer existing or active
        ---cloze-4
        1. A *volcano* is like a mountain that opens downward.
        2. Hot liquid rock under the ground is called *magma*.
        3. When rock comes out of the volcano, it is called *lava*.
        4. A *dormant* volcano is sleeping but might erupt again.

        Part 2: States of Matter
        Read about solids, liquids, and gases.
        ---text
        Three States of Matter
        Everything around us is made of matter. Matter usually comes in three different forms, or states. These states
        are solid, liquid, and gas.

        A solid has a shape that does not change easily. A rock, a book, and a pencil are examples of solids. A liquid
        does not have its own shape. It takes the shape of its container. Milk and juice are liquids. A gas moves freely
        and spreads out to fill any space. The air we breathe is a gas. Some substances, like water, can be a solid, a
        liquid, or a gas at different temperatures.
        ---vocab
        matter: the physical stuff that everything is made of
        state: a condition or form of something (like solid or liquid)
        container: an object like a box or bottle that holds things
        substance: a particular kind of matter or material
        temperature: how hot or cold something is
        ---cloze-4
        1. A *solid* keeps its shape and does not change easily.
        2. A *liquid* takes the shape of its container.
        3. A *gas* moves freely to fill any space.
        4. Water can change states at different *temperatures*.
        ---questions-4
        Q: Which of the following is a solid?
        A: Milk
        A: A pencil [correct]
        A: Air
        Q: What happens to a liquid when you pour it into a new cup?
        A: It becomes a gas.
        A: It keeps its old shape.
        A: It takes the shape of the new cup. [correct]
        Q: Which state of matter moves freely and fills space?
        A: Solid
        A: Gas [correct]
        A: Liquid
        Q: Can water be a solid?
        A: Yes, if the temperature is right. [correct]
        A: No, water is always a liquid.
        A: No, water is always a gas.

        Part 3: Atoms
        Read about the tiny particles that make up the universe.
        ---text
        How Small is an Atom?
        Have you ever wondered what things are made of? Everything in the universe is made of tiny particles called
        atoms. Atoms are very, very small. A single human hair is much wider than an atom. In fact, one hair is as thick
        as 500,000 atoms!

        An atom has a center called the core. Inside the core, there are protons and neutrons. There are also electrons.
        The electrons move around the core very fast. Here is a surprise: Atoms are mostly empty space. If we remove the
        empty space, all the people in the world could fit inside a teaspoon. It is hard to imagine, but it is true!
        ---vocab
        particle: a very tiny piece of something
        core: the center part of an object
        electron: a tiny part of an atom that moves fast
        universe: all of space and everything in it
        imagine: to make a picture of something in your mind
        ---cloze-4
        1. Everything is made of tiny particles called *atoms*.
        2. A single human *hair* is wider than an atom.
        3. The *electrons* move around the core very fast.
        4. Atoms are mostly empty *space*.
        ---questions-4
        Q: Approximately how many atoms fit in the width of a human hair?
        A: 500
        A: 5,000
        A: 500,000 [correct]
        Q: What is inside the core of an atom?
        A: Only electrons.
        A: Protons and neutrons. [correct]
        A: A teaspoon.
        Q: What is the main surprise mentioned about atoms?
        A: They are very heavy.
        A: They are mostly empty space. [correct]
        A: They are visible to the human eye.
        Q: If you removed the empty space, where could all people fit?
        A: Into a swimming pool.
        A: Into a volcano.
        A: Into a teaspoon. [correct]
