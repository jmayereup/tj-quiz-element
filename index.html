Today, sloths are animals that live in the trees in Central and South America. They are famous for being very, very slow. They spend most of their time eating, resting, and sleeping. They only come down from the tree about once a week!

Why are sloths so slow? The reason is their food. Sloths eat almost only leaves. Leaves are difficult to digest and do not give much energy. Because their food is low in energy, the sloth must save energy. They save energy by moving slowly and having less muscle than other animals. They have the slowest metabolism of any mammal.

Your brain is very important. It is small (only 2% of your body), but it uses a lot of energy. It uses 20% of all your body's power! This energy comes from the food you eat. Good food helps your brain. Protein, from meat and eggs, helps you feel calm or alert. Good fats, from fish and nuts, help build your brain and keep it healthy.

Some food gives energy fast. Sugar and white bread give you energy now, but 30 minutes later, you feel tired. Other foods, like oats and grains, give you "slow" energy. This slow energy is better for your brain and helps you pay attention in class.

The sun gives the world a lot of energy. We can use this energy to make electricity. We use special things called solar panels. Light from the sun hits the solar panel. The light moves tiny things called electrons. The electrons move and make electricity. We can use this electricity to power a light bulb or charge a phone.

There are some challenges. Solar energy is not the same everywhere. Some places are sunny, and some places are cloudy. We also need to use batteries to store the energy for use at night. Solar power is getting better. It is also getting cheaper.
