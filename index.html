A Tale of Two Reds
---text
The classic story of Little Red Riding Hood presents its main character as a naive and passive victim who falls for the Big Bad Wolf's obvious tricks and must be saved. The "Fixed Fairy Tales" version radically reimagines this by transforming Little Red into a clever and aware hero. Instead of innocently answering the wolf's questions, this version of Red immediately recognizes the danger and formulates a plan. She seizes control of the narrative, shifting from a character to whom the story happens into the very force that drives the plot forward through her own intelligence and initiative.

This fundamental change in Little Red Riding Hood's character has a ripple effect that alters the entire story, most notably by making the traditional rescuer obsolete. The brave woodcutter is completely absent from this version for one simple reason: he isn't needed. Red's cleverness serves as her own rescue, as she outsmarts the wolf by giving him bad directions. Consequently, the wolf's role is also flipped; he is no longer the cunning predator but the one who is tricked, ultimately leading him to the house of the Three Bears and his presumed demise. Her proactivity not only saves herself but directly causes the antagonist's downfall without any outside help.

Ultimately, these adjustments transform the story's core message from one of cautionary obedience to one of clever empowerment. The traditional moral, "don't talk to strangers," teaches children to avoid danger by following rules. In contrast, the humorous new moral, "always give wolves bad directions," champions the use of one's own wit and self-reliance to overcome threats. The "fixed" story suggests that you don't have to be a passive victim of circumstance; instead, you can be your own hero by thinking critically and creatively to solve your own problems.
