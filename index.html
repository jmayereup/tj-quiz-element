Spiciness and Fear
---text
Spiciness is not a taste, like sweet or sour. It is a feeling of pain and heat. In chili peppers, a chemical called capsaicin causes this feeling. This chemical activates special sensors (neurons) in your mouth. These are the same sensors that feel high temperatures. Because of this, your brain thinks your mouth is actually burning!
---text
Not all spicy food is the same. Chili peppers (like jalape√±os) and black pepper burn your mouth. This is because their spicy chemicals are large and heavy. But wasabi and mustard feel different. Their chemicals are small and light. They float up into your nose. This is why wasabi burns your sinuses (your nose) and chili peppers burn your tongue.
---text
When your body feels a threat (like a big roller coaster), it starts a "fight-or-flight" response. This is an automatic reaction. Chemicals are released in your body. These chemicals give you energy and stop you from feeling pain. This feeling is very similar to excitement or happiness. The big difference is the context (the situation). If you are in real danger, you are focused on survival. But if you are in a safe place (you know the roller coaster will not really hurt you), your brain can enjoy this feeling. It's like a natural "high."
